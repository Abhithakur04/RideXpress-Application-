# Backend API Documentation

## Overview
This API provides various endpoints for managing users and captains, as well as retrieving map and ride-related data. The API uses JWT tokens for authentication and supports a variety of operations such as user registration, login, profile retrieval, and creating rides. It also integrates with OpenStreetMap and OpenRouteService APIs to provide location-related services like coordinates, distance, and time estimation.

---

## Authentication

- **JWT Authentication** is required for most endpoints (e.g., login, profile, and ride-related operations).
- To authenticate, include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your requests:

# Backend API Documentation

## Overview

This is the frontend application for the **Uber Clone**, built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to log in, book a ride, and get location suggestions from the backend, while drivers can accept or reject ride requests.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in to their accounts.
- **Ride Booking**: Users can book a ride by specifying a starting location and destination.
- **Location Suggestions**: After entering an address, the backend suggests possible locations for the start and destination.
- **Car & Bike Selection**: Users can choose between a car or bike for their ride.
- **Driver Request**: When a user books a ride, a request is sent to drivers near the pickup location. Drivers can accept or reject the request.
